# Optimiser
A program for modelling the impact of behavioral change on the energy consumption and electricity bill of a household
The progrom uses time interval data taken from the Pecan Street Project and applies optimisation models to the appliance consumption patterns to try to model the affect that increased customer motivation will have on the over amount of electricity that a household consumes and when that consumption occurs
The aim of this model was to highlight the affect of increased customer motivation to reduce electricity bills on electricity stakeholders
